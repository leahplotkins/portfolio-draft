	<h2 id="successful"> A Well-Designed Web Site</h2>
		<p>
		<!-- Replace the default link URL with the one for your chosen site -->
		<a class="nav-links" href="http://www.thisiscolossal.com/"> Thisiscolassal,</a>
		 is an art blog/website that covers a range of different mediums, artists and styles. Colossal is well designed for its intended user, an art and design loving visual thinker. The background is clean and not overly distracting. The images are large and the text is minimal. The site allows you to take a deeper dive into any of the work shown by linking to a separate page with more information i.e. text, images, links to the artists other work. The quality of all of the images is very high and the text is clear and succinct. The navigation is minimal yet clear and their use of tags allows for filtering and search-ability.

		<p> The footer of each page includes the navigation to get from page to page, social media links and this "trending on colossal" tool. I think this tool is very meaningful to the site because of colossal’s intended users. Everything about this site in catered to someone who is very visual. The use of pictures with role-over descriptions, sparks the users’ curiosity and allows them to quickly get to work that interests them.

	<h2 id="less-successful">A Less Effective Web Site</h2>	
	    <p>
	    <a class="nav-links" href="https://www.genius.com/"> Genius</a> is a website that gives insights into not only the lyrics of songs but also their meanings. Similar to colossal, genius has a lot of information to provide to the user, however the website feels clunky and confusing. Visually the front page of the site is overwhelming the tittle bar in yellow and the menu bar in black is a nice two-toned concept but then purple and pink get introduced in a way that feels almost random. Moving down the site the layout of the 3 videos is nice but is ruined by the text overlay on each of the videos. They could have easily made it a roll-over title and saved the user from some extreme visual noise. Moving down the page to the "top songs" section, the top 3 songs being much larger does not help add emphasis but instead looks awkward. If they were committed to using the pink, they could have used color to help denote this distinction without throwing off the visual balance of the page. The list itself isn't bad just needs some slight adjustment.

		<p> The "lyrics explained" part of the site is actually much better. It uses scroll over highlighting to denote chunks of lyrics and once they are clicked the margin to the right changes to show the interpretation of the song. It allows for comments, editing and suggestions by any user. The large bracket with the arrow also helps to visually attach the lyrics to the commentary. However, they kill me again at the top with their use of color. At the top of each of the pages that gives information on the lyrics, there is a grey bar with the song title, artist, album art, who gave the commentary on this song and a plug-in to play the song. The pastel colors are hard to read on the gray background. They either need to commit to that section being black or they need to tone down their grey and make it much lighter. Their simple to fix design mistakes frustrate me so much because I think the site offers something cool and new and is really using the internet for what it’s meant for.

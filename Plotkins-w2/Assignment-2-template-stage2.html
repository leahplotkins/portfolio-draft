	<h2 id="purpose"> What is the Purpose of the Website? </h2>
		<p>
To show my work, design process and my personality. When someone looks at my site I want them to know me better as an artist and designer. I want them to get a feel for my process without getting bogged down in too many unnecessary details. I want to be able to give someone my website url and be proud of how it looks and functions. Most importantly I want it to be clean and professional.

	<h2 id="audience"> Who is the Intended Audience?</h2>	
	    <p>
The average person who will be looking at my site will be a future employer or acquaintances. These uers typically want a basic overview of what I do and what my work looks like. I need to create a balance of important information without overwhelming a non-designer. I also want my site to be beautiful enough that will empress my design peers and open up potentail collaborations/jobs in the future.

	<section class="tone">
	<h2 id="tone"> What Tone do you want for the Site's Written Content?</h2>	
	    <p>
The tone of the written content on my website will be clear and concise. Sometimes as designers we try to explain with too many details and we end up confusing our viewers. I want to clearly state the problem I was solving, the process I went through and what I created.

	<section class="less-favorable-analysis">
	<h2 id="primary"> What will be the Primary Content of your Site?</h2>	
	    <p>
The landing page will welcome the viewer to the site and give a sentence or two of introduction to the site. Once you enter the site you will be able to scroll through a list (in picture form) of each project. Each picture links to a specific page. The page will have two main components. The first is a section that gives a description of the project including the title, prompt and my approach. The second is a group of images and diagrams the shows the piece.

		<p>I was inspired by these websites especailly the last one from 	<a href="http://www.fuzzco.com/">Fuzzco</a>. I really like how its simple but it has a pop of color.

	<section class="less-favorable-analysis">
	<h2 id="secondary"> What will be the secondary Content?</h2>	
	    <p>
I want to have an about, process, cv and contact page. In my about page I want to have a picture of myself and use a conversational tone to tell views a little information about myself. On the process page I want to talk about my creative/design process in a simple, clear way that allows people to understand me and what I do. On my resume page Iâ€™ll put my resume. And finally on the contact page ill have different ways to contact me and links to my social media.

	<section class="less-favorable-analysis">
	<h2 id="user-nav"> How will users Navigate through your Site?</h2>	
	    <p>
I plan on making my site simple without too many unnecessary options. I want the main focus of my site to be my work and myself as a professional. Making sure there is a clear path to each of my projects and allowing users to pick which project they want to look at is important to the success of my site. The user will have to want to learn more about me to access the secondary information so that they don't feel bombarded. I will also use bread crumbs and photos to help the user orient themselves and understand what they are looking at.

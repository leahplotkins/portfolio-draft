<h3><b>Assignment: </b>Create a body adornment inspired by the tension and compression the body experiences during movement. .<br>
<b>Approach:</b>I was inspired by torso twisting and wanted to create an adornment that would give the illusion of twisting even when the body was in a relaxed state. To do this, I created a 3D torso model in Rhino, manipulated it and noticed that the most tension and compression occurred around the waist. I also noticed that areas of tension stretched the pieces while in the areas of compression the pieces became smaller. I incorporated these findings into my work. To make my piece I hand sewed pieces of bicycle tire inter tube together. Additionally, I created a 3D printed clasp, the series of black circles, that allows my work to open and close.
<br> <b> What I learned:</b> How to combine digital and by-hand fabrication to create unique designs.   </h3>

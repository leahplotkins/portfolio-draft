<h1>Community <br> Blocks</h1>       
<h3><b>Assignment: </b>Create a learning tool to teach first grade students social studies.<br>
<b>Approach:</b>To make a game that engages the students and teaches them about community and valuing others. To do this I made blocks that stack together with people pasted on them. To play the game the students take turns picking cards with I statements that match one of the professions of the blocks. Once the student picks the correct block they add it to the stack. They get to learn about how each person adds value to the community regardless of their gender identity, ethnicity, educational level, job, etc. 
<br> <b> What I learned:</b> How to gain perspective and understanding of my products through user testing. </h3>
